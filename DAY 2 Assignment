Question 1 :
Find the output of the following code snippet: 
int i =0, j = 0;
int *p = &i, *q = &j;
q = p;
*q = 2
cout<<i<<" "<<j;

Answer:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
	// your code goes here
	int i =0, j = 0;
    int *p = &i, *q = &j;
    q = p;
    *q = 2;
    cout<<i<<" "<<j;
    return 0;
}

Output:
//As P is pointing towards the adderess of i and q is pointing towards address of j intialilly then after the assignment 
of q=p now q starts pointing towards i and and updates the value at i=0 to 2 so values at the output be

2 0
